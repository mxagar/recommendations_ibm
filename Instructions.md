# Recommender System for the IBM Watson Studio Network: Instructions

Check the [project introduction video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKfmT1R_oJM).

Goal: analyze interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson studio platform; make recommendation of new articles to populate a recommendation dashboard.

Tasks:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis
    - Answer questions in notebook.
2. Rank-based recommendations
    - Most popular articles for new users.
3. User-user-based recommendations
    - Find similar users in terms of items and suggest new items of those users.
4. Content-based recommendations (extra, not required)
    - Use NLP to create content features.
5. Matrix factorization (spoiler: it doesn't work that well).
    - Discuss which methods to use, how, how to evaluate, etc.

## Project Rubric

- Code Functionality & Readability
    - Code runs
    - Tests pass
    - Documentation
    - DRY
- Part I: Data Exploration: All required metrics computed.
- Part II: Create Rank Based Recommendations
    - Implemented, tests passing.
- Part III: Collaborative Filtering
    - User-item matrix
    - Find similar users
    - Recommendations with user-user interactions
    - Recommendations to new users
- Part V: Matrix Factorization
    - SVD; explain.
    - Train/test split.
    - Evaluate: predicted vs. actual.
    - Results and discussion.

To stand out:

- Web app
- Package
- Content-based recommendations with NLP
