In such cases, there exists a closed-form solution and we don't need to apply gradient descend or similar optimization algorithms. In the present case, we don't have user ratings, but rather flags indicating wether the user has interacted with an article; thus, we can set the value `0` for all cells associated to a user-article interaction which has not occurred. In case we had, e.g., ratings, we would have had `NaN` values; in those situations, we need to use the FunkSVD or a similar method which works only with non-`NaN` interactions."
